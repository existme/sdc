SDC: Software Development Cheatsheet
====================================

This is a collection of different cheatsheets, workarounds, or shortcuts 
collected from internet and gathered in a Latex document inorder to create a 
handy customizable (and eye appealing) document. After some time, I thought
that it might be a good idea to share it with others in order to improve the 
whole document and benefit from open source force while providing a little bit
contribution. 

I am completly novice in opensource climate, and this is my first attempt so 
please tolerate lack of dicipline, or proper structure. This is my first
attempt, so bear me please.

And of course any kind of help/idea in improving this document is highly appreciated :-)

Why LaTeX?
===========
The main points of creating this project for myself was to create a
managable document with the following properties:

* Easy editing of different chapters and sections
* Producing a parital/full portable document (pdf)
* Customizable styles and commands to ease technical document writing
* Providing plugable features
* Reach formatable document

All these features and much much more are available in LaTeX. Although you might
debate that why not other formats like markdown or html, I would say well first
of all it's a matter of preference and second I think that LaTeX, although is to
some extents more complex, provides much more flexibility and at the end easier
to manage.

Todo:
====
* Add documentation for the commands and environment used in the project
* Provide a better structure and do a proof reading
